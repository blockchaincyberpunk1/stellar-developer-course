Instructions for Advanced Students:

Assignment Task:

Advanced Stellar Application Development

In this optional assignment, you will have the opportunity to work on a more complex Stellar application project. You can choose one of the following advanced projects or propose your own Stellar-related project for approval by the instructor:

Option 1: Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on Stellar (40 points):

Develop a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Stellar network where users can trade custom tokens.
Implement order matching, order book management, and trading functions.
Ensure secure and transparent trading operations.
Document the DEX architecture, functionality, and code.
Option 2: Atomic Swaps on Stellar (40 points):

Create a Stellar-based application that allows users to perform atomic swaps between different tokens on the network.
Implement the necessary smart contracts and user interfaces for atomic swaps.
Ensure security and provide clear instructions for users.
Document the atomic swap application, including code and usage instructions.
Option 3: Multi-Signature Wallet Application (40 points):

Build a multi-signature wallet application on Stellar.
Allow users to create multi-signature accounts, add signers, and perform transactions requiring multiple signatures.
Implement security features to protect user accounts.
Document the multi-signature wallet application, including its features and code.
Option 4: Proposed Project (Subject to Approval) (40 points):

If you have a specific Stellar-related project idea, you can propose it to the instructor for approval.
Your proposed project should be challenging and demonstrate your advanced understanding of Stellar development.
Once approved, develop the project and document it thoroughly.
Assignment Requirements:

Choose one of the advanced project options (Option 1, 2, or 3) or propose your own (Option 4, subject to approval).

Plan your project carefully, considering the architecture, features, and user experience.

Develop the project using Stellar SDKs and any other relevant tools or libraries.

Test the application thoroughly to ensure functionality and security.

Provide comprehensive documentation for your project, including architecture diagrams, code explanations, and usage instructions.

Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment by providing the source code and detailed documentation for your advanced Stellar application.
Share a link to your project repository or a ZIP file containing the code and documentation.
