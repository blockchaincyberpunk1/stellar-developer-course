Token Issuance and Distribution

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: This assignment aims to give students hands-on experience in the process of token issuance and distribution on the Stellar network. Students will create a custom token, issue tokens to a distribution account, and then distribute these tokens to multiple user accounts, simulating a real-world scenario.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Token Issuance and Distribution Simulation

In this assignment, you will simulate a real-world scenario where you need to issue and distribute custom tokens to users. This will help you understand the practical aspects of token issuance and distribution on the Stellar network.

Assignment Requirements:

Token Creation (20 points):

Create a custom token on the Stellar testnet with a specified name, symbol (e.g., XYZ), and total supply (e.g., 1,000,000 tokens).
Ensure that the token creation process adheres to Stellar's standards.
Document the steps and code used for token creation.
Token Issuance (20 points):

Issue a specific number of tokens from the newly created token supply to a distribution account.
Verify that the tokens are correctly issued to the distribution account.
Document the issuance process and any challenges faced.
User Accounts (20 points):

Create multiple user accounts on the Stellar testnet. You can simulate user accounts for this assignment.
Document the account creation process.
Token Distribution (30 points):

Develop a secure and transparent token distribution process from the distribution account to the user accounts.
Ensure that tokens are distributed accurately to the user accounts.
Document the token distribution process, including any transaction details.
Documentation and Instructions (10 points):

Provide clear and concise documentation for the entire token issuance and distribution process.
Include instructions for setting up and running the simulation.
Offer examples and explanations of how token issuance and distribution are implemented.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment by providing the source code and documentation.
Share a link to your project repository or a ZIP file containing the code and documentation.
