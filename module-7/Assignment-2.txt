Asset Tokenization DApp

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to develop practical skills in building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Stellar network. Students will create a DApp on Stellar for asset tokenization, enabling users to tokenize real-world assets (e.g., real estate, stocks) and trade them on the Stellar network. This assignment emphasizes the implementation of secure practices for handling asset ownership and provides hands-on experience with DApp development.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Asset Tokenization DApp

DApp Development (40 points):

Develop a decentralized application (DApp) on the Stellar network that facilitates the tokenization of real-world assets.
Your DApp should allow users to:
Create and issue custom tokens representing real-world assets (e.g., real estate tokens, stock tokens).
List these tokens on a marketplace or exchange within the DApp.
Trade tokens with other users.
Implement secure practices for handling asset ownership, ensuring that tokenized assets are associated with the rightful owners.
User Documentation (20 points):

Create comprehensive user documentation or a user guide for your Asset Tokenization DApp.
Explain how users can:
Tokenize real-world assets using the DApp.
List tokens for trading.
Trade tokens with other users.
Include clear instructions and screenshots to guide users through the process.
Security Measures (20 points):

Describe the security measures and best practices you've implemented to ensure the secure handling of asset ownership and transactions.
Explain how the DApp protects against unauthorized access and fraudulent activities.
Testing and Validation (10 points):

Thoroughly test your Asset Tokenization DApp to ensure that it functions correctly and securely.
Provide a summary of the testing process and any challenges faced during testing.
Presentation (Optional - 10 points):

If required by the instructor, present your Asset Tokenization DApp to the class, highlighting its functionalities, security features, and testing results.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit the code and documentation for your Asset Tokenization DApp.
If a presentation is required, follow the instructor's guidelines for the presentation.
