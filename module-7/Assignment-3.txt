Micropayments Solution

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to encourage students to build decentralized applications (DApps) that solve real-world problems using micropayments on the Stellar network. Students will design and implement a DApp that facilitates efficient micropayments for a specific use case (e.g., content monetization, pay-as-you-go services). The DApp should securely handle microtransactions and provide a user-friendly experience.
