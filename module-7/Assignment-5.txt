Deployment and User Testing

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to prepare students for the real-world deployment and testing of their Stellar decentralized applications (DApps). Students will deploy either their asset tokenization DApp or micropayments solution on a testnet or live Stellar network. They will invite classmates to participate in user testing, collect valuable feedback, and document the deployment process for future reference.
