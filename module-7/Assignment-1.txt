Stellar Anchor Simulation

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the role of Stellar anchors in the Stellar network and educate them about compliance requirements. Students will create a simulation of a Stellar anchor, developing a simplified anchor application that issues tokens on the Stellar network, accepts deposits in fiat currency, and facilitates withdrawals. They will also consider and document their compliance procedures to ensure adherence to relevant financial regulations.
