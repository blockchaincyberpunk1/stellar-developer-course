Assignment Task:

Creating a Stellar Dashboard

In this optional assignment, you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge of Stellar's technology stack to build a web-based Stellar dashboard. This project will allow you to interact with the Stellar network, retrieve real-time data from the Stellar testnet, and display it in a user-friendly interface.

Assignment Requirements:

Dashboard Design (20 points):

Design a user-friendly dashboard interface using HTML/CSS. The design should be clear, visually appealing, and responsive (adapted for different screen sizes).
Data Retrieval (30 points):

Real-Time Updates (20 points):

Implement a mechanism to periodically refresh and update the displayed data to reflect changes on the Stellar testnet. This should provide a real-time experience for dashboard users.
