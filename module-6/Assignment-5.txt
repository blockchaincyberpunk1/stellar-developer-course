Security Audit (Optional)

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to engage advanced students in a comprehensive security audit of a complex Stellar application. Students will conduct a thorough security audit of the application's code, identify potential vulnerabilities (e.g., smart contract vulnerabilities, transaction issues), and propose security enhancements. The goal is to provide students with hands-on experience in assessing the security of real-world applications and producing formal security audit reports.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Comprehensive Security Audit

Select an Application (10 points):

Choose a complex Stellar application from the list provided by the instructor or propose your own application (subject to instructor approval).
Ensure that the selected application involves Stellar smart contracts, transactions, or significant interaction with the Stellar network.
Code Review (30 points):

Obtain access to the codebase of the selected application.
