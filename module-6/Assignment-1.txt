Secure Key Management

Course: Stellar Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce secure key management practices for Stellar accounts. Students will develop a key management application for Stellar accounts, focusing on generating and securely storing key pairs, implementing multi-signature setups, and ensuring the safe signing of transactions. This assignment aims to enhance students' understanding of secure key management and its importance in blockchain development.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Develop a Secure Key Management Application for Stellar Accounts

Your task is to create a key management application for Stellar accounts that adheres to best practices for security. This application should encompass the following key aspects:

Key Pair Generation (20 points):

Develop a feature within your application that can securely generate Stellar key pairs.
Implement strong cryptographic methods for key generation.
Ensure that private keys are generated and stored securely.
Multi-Signature Setup (20 points):

Design and implement multi-signature setups for Stellar accounts. Multi-signature accounts require multiple signers to approve transactions.
Configure and test multi-signature scenarios with different signer accounts.
Transaction Signing (20 points):

Enable the secure signing of transactions using the generated key pairs.
Implement proper transaction signing procedures that include verification and authorization steps.
Secure Key Storage (20 points):

Address secure key storage by devising a method to store private keys safely.
Discuss encryption and protection mechanisms used to safeguard private keys.
Documentation (10 points):

Provide clear documentation for your key management application.
Explain how the application handles key generation, multi-signature setup, and transaction signing.
Include instructions for users on how to use the application securely.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment by sharing a link to your project repository or a ZIP file containing the application code and documentation.
Ensure that your documentation is clear and provides sufficient information for others to understand and use your key management application securely.
Grading Rubric:
